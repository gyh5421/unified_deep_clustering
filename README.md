# unified_deep_clustering
This is the official implementation of the paper "Learning the Precise Feature for Cluster Assignment" published in IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics.

To train on MNIST, please just run "python gan_mnist.py".

"train_class_cost.jpg" and "train_disc_cost.jpg" are respectively the variance of the estimated entropy and earth-mover distance during training on MNIST.

The images in the fold "samples" are generated samples of the generator during training on MNIST.
